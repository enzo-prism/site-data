Thanks for helping keep site data accurate and well documented.

## Add or update data
- Add new files under `data/`.
- Use descriptive, kebab-case file names.
- Keep files focused on a single dataset or concept.
- If you are replacing data, keep the file name stable when possible.

## Document sources
- Add a short note in `docs/` describing the source, retrieval date, and any transforms.
- If data is derived, include the inputs and the steps used to produce it.

## Review checklist
- Data files validate for their format (JSON, YAML, CSV, etc.).
- Documentation for the change is present in `docs/`.
- No secrets or personal data are included.
